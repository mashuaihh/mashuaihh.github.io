title: How many will 'all' find?
---

I guess this is pretty basic, but I actually wrote code to ascertain it.
The html is like this:
{% highlight html %}
<div class="class1 class2 ng-hide">
<div class="class1 class2">
<div class="class1 class2">
{% endhighlight %}

How many elements will be found using "all(by.css('.class1.class2')" ?
The answer is 3.
